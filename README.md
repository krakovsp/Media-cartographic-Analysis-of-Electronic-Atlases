# Media-cartographic-Analysis-of-Electronic-Atlases
The repository contains the results of the author's media-cartographic analysis of two electronic atlases: The European Atlas of the Seas (EAS) (https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/atlas/maritime_atlas) and The Czech Historical Atlas (CHA) (https://cha.fsv.cvut.cz/en). The analysis is based on quantitative (QCA) and qualitative (CA) content analysis methods. The purpose of the analysis was 1) to identify the implementation of the electronic atlases' components as applications; 2) to define the meta-concept of each electronic atlas; 3) to compare the electronic atlas concept described by the authors with its practical implementation; 4) to identify common and distinctive features of both atlases.
